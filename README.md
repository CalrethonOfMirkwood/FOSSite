# Week 1
Most of week 1 was spent on ideation and planning the course.
| Name | Task |
| - | :--- |
| Sophie | Sophie worked with Valerie to create a rough outline of the [course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z1GYSwubeXHscKTN5EzRGT2B-IAYzG0vddGxIzL9HNA/edit?skip_itp2_check=true).  She also made her about page with a reddit API (the error 500 page links to an alternative page without the API for school wifi). |
| Valreie | Valerie created the syllabus (see above) and also made custom error pages and the about me page.  It has music and other customization. |
| Michael | Michael also worked on the aforementioned syllabus and made his about page.  He also looked into ideas for deployment, likely on his own server at home. |
| Krish | Krish spent most of his time on wireframing the site, creating a prototype for the front page + lesson page template.  To do this he studied bootstrap and CSS. |
