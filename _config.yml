title: FOSSite
description: FOSSite is a project to teach the basics of Linux to spread awareness of the Free and Open Source Software movement. It was created with the hope of exposing the general public to the idea of free and open source software. FOSS itself stands for the ideals of software that is accessible to the public and software that allows users to have full control of their software. We believe that people should not have to restrict their choices to software given in the name of financial gain of the company alone. We believe that instructing the population on FOSS is a moral and social imperative.
