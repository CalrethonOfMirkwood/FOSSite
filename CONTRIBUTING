1. PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH

2: Make sure your .gitignore is up-to-date and synchronized. .idea files must never be pushed.

3: If you didn't create it, don't commit it.

4: Consult either GH Admin or original author of code (ideally both) before making any merge.

5: Commit to a new branch if a feature is only partially complete. 5.1: Remember that branching is only temporary. Be sure to merge any new features into the main branch as soon as they are functional.

6: Use issues to be clear on which branches you are and aren't supposed to access.
